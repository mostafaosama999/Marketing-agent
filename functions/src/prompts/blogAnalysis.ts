‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. NEVER return empty strings ("") for reasoning/evidence/summary fields
2. ALL reasoning fields MUST be at least 100 characters long with SPECIFIC examples
3. If you cannot determine something, say "Unable to determine" with explanation - NOT empty string
4. Quote actual phrases from the content to support your analysis
5. Be HARSH but FAIR in your ratings - don't inflate scores

YOUR TASK:
Perform a rigorous content quality analysis. We need to distinguish between:
- HIGH-quality: Deep technical content that experienced developers value
- LOW-quality: Generic marketing fluff or AI-generated surface-level content

ANALYSIS CRITERIA:

1. TECHNICAL DEPTH
   - Are there code examples? (actual implementations, not just snippets)
   - What technical concepts are covered? (algorithms, architecture, protocols?)
   - Does it explain HOW things work internally, not just WHAT they are?
   - Target audience: beginners vs. experienced developers?
   - Product internals and implementation details shown?

2. AI-GENERATED CONTENT DETECTION (Be thorough - this is critical!)
   üö® STRONG AI-writing indicators (if 3+ present, likely AI-written):
   - Generic intros: "In today's fast-paced world", "In the ever-evolving landscape", "In recent years"
   - Repetitive sentence structures: Every paragraph starts same way
   - Overly polished without personality: No humor, no opinions, no "I" or "we"
   - Lack of specifics: No real metrics, dates, company names, or concrete examples
   - Surface-level only: Explains WHAT but never HOW or WHY at technical level
   - Listicles without depth: "5 ways to...", "10 tips for..." with 2-3 sentences each
   - Generic conclusions: "In conclusion...", "As we've seen...", restate intro without adding value
   - Buzzword density: Every sentence has "innovative", "seamless", "cutting-edge", "robust"
   - No code examples despite technical topic
   - No controversy or strong opinions (AI plays it safe)

   üéØ Human-written indicators:
   - Specific war stories: "When we tried X at Company Y, Z happened"
   - Strong opinions: "X is terrible because...", "Everyone says Y but they're wrong"
   - Actual code with comments explaining decisions
   - Real metrics/data: "We reduced latency from 500ms to 50ms"
   - Personality/humor: Jokes, sarcasm, colloquialisms
   - Multiple authors with different writing styles

3. CONTENT TYPE & FUNNEL STAGE
   - Top-of-funnel: "What is X?" content, generic tutorials, listicles
   - Middle-funnel: Use cases, comparisons, best practices with some depth
   - Bottom-funnel: Deep dives, architecture, product internals, advanced concepts

4. CODE & DIAGRAMS
   - Count actual code blocks with real implementations
   - What languages/frameworks? (Python, Go, JavaScript, etc.)
   - Are there system diagrams, architecture diagrams, data flows?
   - Technical illustrations showing how things work?

5. EVIDENCE & EXAMPLES
   - Quote specific passages that demonstrate quality (or lack of it)
   - Identify real technical topics mentioned
   - Note any AI-writing red flags found

RATING GUIDELINES (Be HARSH but FAIR):

HIGH (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê):
- 3+ code examples per post with real implementations
- Architecture/system diagrams present
- Advanced technical concepts (distributed systems, algorithms, protocols)
- Real product implementation details and internals
- Targets experienced developers
- NOT AI-generated
- Bottom-of-funnel content
Example topics: "Implementing Raft consensus in Go", "Our database query optimizer internals"

MEDIUM (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê):
- 1-2 code examples per post
- Solid technical explanations with some depth
- Practical but not deeply advanced
- May mix some marketing with technical content
- Intermediate developers can learn from it
Example topics: "Building a REST API with error handling", "Deploying with Docker best practices"

LOW (‚≠ê‚≠ê):
- No or minimal code examples
- Generic marketing language
- Surface-level "What is X?" content
- AI-generated patterns detected (generic intros, repetitive structure)
- Top-of-funnel only
- Could be written by someone with no deep expertise
Example topics: "5 Benefits of Cloud Computing", "Why You Need Event-Driven Architecture"
